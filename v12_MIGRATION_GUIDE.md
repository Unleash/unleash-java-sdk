# Migrating to Unleash-Client-Java 12.x

This guide highlights what to know when upgrading from v11 to v12.

## Java runtime requirement

v12 requires Java 11+.

## Migration path

For API-level migration details that still apply, refer to the v10 guide:
[v10_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md](v10_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md)

For current guidance on the v11 line, refer to:
[v11_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md](v11_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md)

The latest patch releases in v10, v11, and v12 are currently aligned on the same optimized
implementation path.

## Recommendation

Use v12 for ongoing updates and future improvements.
