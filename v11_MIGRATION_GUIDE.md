# Migrating to Unleash-Client-Java 11.x

This guide highlights what to know when upgrading from v10 to v11.

## Java runtime requirement

v11 requires Java 11+.

## Migration path

For API-level migration details, refer to the v10 guide:
[v10_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md](v10_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md)

The latest patch releases in v10, v11, and v12 are currently aligned on the same optimized
implementation path.

Early v11 introduced a WASM-engine direction that we later reverted in v11 patch releases.

## Recommendation

v11 is maintained for stability and critical fixes when needed, but for ongoing updates and new
improvements, prefer v12.
